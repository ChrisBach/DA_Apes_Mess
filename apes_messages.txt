Le Quang Sinh: i won’t be in Krakow this weekend:( enjoy guys!!
Ly Huong Do: Thời gian địa điểm rõ ràng what else to check?
Nguyễn Mạnh Phúc: I will check for it as soon as i have time

Mi Mi: Maybe once we comfirm who will def join, we can maybe find  a room to share tgt? Or if someone have a place to stay at a friend's house etc then it's fine;)❤Ly Huong Do
Mi Mi: My bf will not join
Mi Mi: I wont be here so enjoyyyy haha😆Minh Anh
Mi Mi: Get well soon Ly 😰❤Ly Huong Do
Mi Mi: I am okay with 221 zloty ticket tho 🤣❤Ly Huong Do
Ly Huong Do: I’d love to, if the flu is gone by then 🥲 just caught it yesterday lol😢Mi Mi
Minh Anh: Anyonw wanna join me for indoor climbing this weekend? :D
Ly Huong Do: Omg jesus 🤣😆Mi Mi
Minh Anh: I think i might join too 😆 dont have any plans yet atm anw :))❤Ly Huong Do
Nguyễn Mạnh Phúc: Click for video:😆Mi Mi😆Bạch Hải Cương😆Ly Huong Do
Ly Huong Do: there you go 🤪 one person fell into the marketing/sales trap *boom*😆Bạch Hải Cương
Bạch Hải Cương: If we are talking the cheapest one, on D8-9, and from your marketing it’s still possible to enjoy it, well, count me in then❤Ly Huong Do😆Vân Thúy
Bạch Hải Cương: I’m not in your We hahaha😠Ly Huong Do
Ly Huong Do: And everybody blocked our fucking eyesight
Ly Huong Do: Lol righttt… and the stadium is not too big, thus from the seating you are able to see the artist yourself… last time we couldn’t see Ed clearly cuz we were in the standing area 🥲
Bạch Hải Cương: It looks lika a mirror for makeup 😂😆Ly Huong Do
Ly Huong Do: Ofc, Ed had screens all over the place
Bạch Hải Cương: But you could see the big screen yeah?
Ly Huong Do: But Warsaw stadium has a rounded seating set up, so the audience can see what’s going on no matter where they sit
Ly Huong Do: For example for this design there’s no seat in the back and they set up the stage facing front only
Ly Huong Do: 
Ly Huong Do: Anw up to you guys, i think i will still go 🤪
Ly Huong Do: I dont think they would sell a ticket  where ppl are able to see nothing lol
Ly Huong Do: Its an open stage
Ly Huong Do: If its designed like this then no back stage at all
Bạch Hải Cương: Hahah, no view, that doesnt make sense
Ly Huong Do: 
Minh Anh: I think with d8-9 you will just see the back of the stage. Though I guess the stage will move around too but still probably not that great
Ly Huong Do: 
Ly Huong Do: if we sit in D8-D9 area, would we be able to see anything? 🤣 it's the cheapest - 221zl
Ly Huong Do: not sure how the stage looks like tbh… last time Ed had this stage going in circle so basically we can seat anywhere and still see him anw
Ly Huong Do: but yeah for general admission (standing area) and seating on the front/side, pretty expensive (800-over 1000), 200-500 are only for those at the back
Ly Huong Do: a bit different in the prices

Mi Mi: Haha why nott
Nguyễn Mạnh Phúc: Finally i can bring my Buffalo dried meat😮Mi Mi❤Ly Huong Do
Mi Mi: At 8
Mi Mi: Domowska also fully booked😢Ly Huong Do
Nguyễn Mạnh Phúc: Sound like a perfect plan
Ly Huong Do: the last resort is that you guys could bring games, beers and alcohols to my place and we could party here hahaha➕Mi Mi😆Vân Thúy
Mi Mi: Sure i will try❤Ly Huong Do
Ly Huong Do: could someone try to call them again later pls? I am having meetings from now till 7pm
Ly Huong Do: I’ve called Domowka several times but no one picked up
Ly Huong Do: Hex is fully booked for this evening, only 1 table free at 10.30pm - which is pretty late
Vân Thúy: Omg ew
Le Quang Sinh: me and Lily might join you as well so just in case 8 in total
Mi Mi: Hahah omg i also watched it ytd i like how they mixed the fantasy in it 🤣😂 and all the jokes❤Ly Huong Do
Bạch Hải Cương: ✨
Ly Huong Do: And the one where those guys stick sth in their buttholes 🥲 and when they have sausage fingers and put those into each other’s mouth, then their mouths are filled with ketchup and mustard hahaha 🤣😆Mi Mi
Ly Huong Do: Click for video:
Ly Huong Do: Guys I just watched Everything everywhere all at once yesterday and man that movie is pretty weird 🤣🤣🤣 for example this scene
Minh Anh: I think that’s it. Nhi is working late and she cant join us
Mi Mi: Perfect
Ly Huong Do: Anyone else?
Ly Huong Do: We have: Van, Mimi, Manh, Ly, Phuc +1, Cuong > 7 in total
Vân Thúy: ✨
Ly Huong Do: Dont be late guys
Ly Huong Do: Its open at 5pm so i’ll call them to reserve a table for us at 8pm❤Mi Mi
Ly Huong Do: If so, let’s go to Hex eh? Its close to the old town so if we wanna go clubbing we could quickly switch
Mi Mi: But im pretty sure it would be so crowded as its also not so big
Mi Mi: Actually im good with any but pour ya has good beer lol
Minh Anh: Vote for Pour Ya👍Mi Mi👍Bạch Hải Cương
Minh Anh: Vote for Hex/Domowka👍Bạch Hải Cương👍Minh Anh
Minh Anh: so we have 3 options right? Hex, Pour Ya, and Domowka. actually 2 cause Hex/Domowka are basically the same :)) I think we can vote by liking the message here
Ly Huong Do: I think we should reserve a table for us all if we wanna have a place to sit down 🤣 let’s just finalize place and time, i can call them later👍Mi Mi
Mi Mi: There is one line thats barely visible so i will fix it haha
Ly Huong Do: Why do you wanna get it fixed? They both look good❤Mi Mi
Mi Mi: And I think must be so crowded tonight
Mi Mi: Nope Pour ya only beer , food and talk haha
Ly Huong Do: Yeppp
Ly Huong Do: We usually go to Domowka or Hex so both of them are fine by me. Seems like others wanna play games eh? Pour Ya sounds cool, they don’t offer games there, do they?
Mi Mi: But you will join for some drinks later right? So see yahhh
Mi Mi: I will have a tattoo fixing appointment at 18 something so after that maybe i will just grab something fast to eat around😂
